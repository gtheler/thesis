::::::: {lang=en-US}


This Software Design Specifications (SDS) document applies to an imaginary Software Requirement Specifications (SRS) document issued by a fictitious agency asking for vendors to offer a free and open source cloud-based computational tool to solve engineering problems. The latter can be seen as a “Request for Quotation” and the former as an offer for the fictitious tender. Each section  of this SDS addresses one section of the SRS. The original text from the SRS is shown quoted at the very beginning before the actual SDS content.
